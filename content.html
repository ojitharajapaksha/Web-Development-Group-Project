            <p>Infrastructure development, sustainable industrialization and innovation. 
                This aims to build disaster-resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and 
                sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation for economic growth and social progress.</p>
            <p>Resilient infrastructure is systems and structures designed to withstand and recover quickly from various challenges, 
                including natural disasters and climate change. Examples include rainwater management solutions in 
                Denmark and disaster resilience initiatives in Japan.</p>
